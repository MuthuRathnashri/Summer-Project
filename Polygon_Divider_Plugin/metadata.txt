name=Polygon Divider
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
description=Polygon Divider is a plugin it takes a polygon and efficiently divides it into a number of 'squareish' polygons of a defined size
version=0.1
author=Muthu Rathnashri
email=rathnashri2004@gmail.com

about=There are two options available to the user when dividing a polygon. The above uses the absorb method, whereby all of the polygons are slightly larger than the requested size, in order to 'absorb' any odd-sized 'offcuts' that would otherwise be left behind. The other alternative would be the offcut method. An example of this is given below, in which all of the polygons would be the precise size as requested, except for the light green one at the very top, which represente the offcut:
